(now known an kolkata) family on January 12 , 1863. His father was a well known lawyer and his mother was cultured and  
aristocratic woman. As a boy ,Narendra was an excellent athelte and superlative student. he read everything ravenously 
and retaind everything he read. Never content to believe what he was told , he always demanded incontrovertible proof or
experiential cerainty before he would believe anything.

<dt> <h3>Vivekananda's ZEAL towards god</h3> </dt>

<dd>Vivekananda was deeply religious and this same interigty coloured his quest for god.He went one religious man to another
and asked them if they had seen God. Finally, met Sri Ramakrishna who was the only one to tell yes, he had seen God and could 
show Narendra too. Thus began the discipleship of this highly educated and cultured boy to the mostly illiterate rustic temple 
priest saint. After five years of training , his teacher died. Before Sri Ramakrishna had named Narendra, the leader of all his
disciples, young Narendra took the Monastic name , Swami Vivekananda and founded a monastery where he and his brother disciples
could carry on their spipritual practices . Following Indian monastic tradition.

<P> The book written by him are very influential and still seen as fundamental texts for any intersted in the Hindu practice of yoga. 
His letters are of great literary and spiritual value. He was also very good singer and a poet. He had composed many songs including    
godess, kali the Mother. He used humour for his teachings.His language is very free flowing. His own bengali writings stand stand testimony
to the fact that he believed that words- spoken or written should be for making things easier to understand rather than shoe off the speaker
